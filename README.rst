arc.el
======
An Emacs mode for the `Arc <http://www.paulgraham.com/arc.html>`_ dialect of Lisp

The code is from the `Arc wiki <https://sites.google.com/site/arclanguagewiki/getting-started/installing-emacs>`_, with modifications to support REPL interaction.

The REPL interaction code is adapted with minor modifications from similar functionality implemented in `racket-mode <https://github.com/greghendershott/racket-mode>`_.
